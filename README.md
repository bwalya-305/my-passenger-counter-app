# my-passenger-counter-app
This is a app that I have created as part of the learning module from the "Learn JavaScript Course" on https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript. The source of the background image I used for my app can be found here: https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/389/2019/12/subway-332389232-web.jpg. This app is useful if you are working at a substation for example, and your job is to count the number of people that used the subway that particular day. To help make your job easier you can avoid writing all the information down on paper by simply using this app.
